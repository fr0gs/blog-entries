# Ice Hockey vs. EU football: information overload

During a two week travel to Eastern Canada, I had the opportunity to attend to an Ice Hockey match for the first time in my life, and I was amazed and had a great time watching and enjoying the event.

Being spanish generally means I have been heavily exposed to football (the european counterpart) since I was a little kid. Despite of not being particularly fan, the sport is so popular it occupies a big slice of day by day conversations, so I can confindently say I know the sport and it's context quite well.

What blew me away was the way the entertainment experience was handled, from the point of view of advertisements to the stimuli overload people go through. From the outside of the stadium until we got into our seats, every new room or hallway we accessed was furnished with all sorts of entertainment and consumption opportunities.


## Football

Outside stadiums you often find several small trolleys with some merchandising: trumpets, t-shirts, scarves, socks, etc..

Additionally, one you get inside, in the outer ring (before going to the seats) the stadium has several booths where one can buy drinks, food or more merchandising.

Once you find your seat, depending on how many levels of terraces the building has, the common thing is to see two or three bands of advertisements:

* One **at the level of the football field**. This is the most common on, as you constantly see them from the TV whenever a match is playing.
* One or two **in the base of the different terrace levels**. This ones you can spot them from the inside of the stadium.

Besides this, I don't recall special or additional advertisement or marketing strategies being used. The centerpiece remains the sport itself.

### Outside

When you walk into the stadium you stumble upon several sports merchandising shops before the tickets & security control.

The building had four floors, each a big hallway surrounding the terrace seats. In these hallways, you can find multiple bars to buy beer and food, a couple of small souvenir booths and wandering team mascots in costume for you to take pictures with and have a little fun.

Additionally, there are some people walking around with beer-to-go keg & siphon kits to fill your glass up.

### Inside

From within the field, just like in football, advertisement panels surround the ice field, being replaced each one of the two pauses.

When you look above to the terraces, two big neon rings describing the perimeter of the stadium show rotating ads, one per level. Also, each one of the field's access doors is crowned with a big LED screen, showing different brands and products.

Way above the playing field, presiding the whole building is a huge four-screen structure. This piece serves several purposes, depending on the moment. Every *2~3 minutes* the game is paused to show different content on the screen:

* A minigame with someone from the public participating in order to get a prize whilst mentioning a sponsor.
* A kiss-cam or randomly pointing at people for them to greet the camera.
* Some lottery-based game.
* Cheerful sentences.

It became apparent to me the constant lights and colors shifts, along with beating heavy metal or reggaeton music, specifically designed to pump up people.

A constant flow of vendors keeps periodically passing next to the seats with hot-dogs, beer or popcorn.

In each one of the two pauses, a small show is performed in the ice field where multiple young guys and girls shoot t-shirts into the public areas where they make the most noise, encouraging them to roar and shout.



Overall, the experience is dazzling. You never get the chance of being bored, disappointed, or think about something else, you are being constantly bombarded with so much stimuli and information you feel energized and happy.

However, it is also important to know and be aware of the techniques they are being used to sell and persuade us to buy.
